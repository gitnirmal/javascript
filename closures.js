/*
	Defination of closures
	A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function's variablesâ€”scope chain. 
	The closure has three scope chains: it has access to its own scope (variables defined between its curly brackets), 
	it has access to the outer function's variables, and it has access to the global variables.
